Architecture
I'm thinking, to keep our high-level crypto and user interface logic away from our ugly threading and networking code, maybe we can have a library that does all that for us.
We would communicate with it by signing up callback functions to certain events, such as receiving a chat, sending a chat, connecting, disconnecting, or on error.
Key functions:
connect_to_server
disconnect_from_server
enter_chatroom
send_chat
